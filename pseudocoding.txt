BEGIN
    - Creating phase, planning & theory:
        - Create a JS Fighting game.
        - Create Header & Footer.
            Header will display game details and stats.
            Footer will display key buttons and some instructions etc. [done]
        - Create a main-container that will take the whole browser's 100% width and 100% height. [done]
        - Create a DIV that will holds the character's image, this will be the hero character. [done]
        - Create a DIV that will holds the enemy's image, this will be the enemy in the game. [done]
        - Create Menus in the main page. [done]
            - Press any key to Start!, will display all 3 options. [done]
                - Start Game [done]
                - Controls
                - Credits
    - Initialization phase:
        - For testing purposes, will try with divs for now. [done]
        - Hero Character UI [done]
        - Enemy UI
        - Init hero character's div, width, height, border(to see where it is in the page.) [done]
        - Init enemy character's div, width, height, border(to see where it is in the page.) [done]
        - Set both div's to absolute [done], so I can freely move the characters around by changing the div's top and left value. [done]
        - For stats
    - Add page buttons [done], this will make the hero navigates all throughout the game. [done]
    - Theory: Find a way to add an event listener of key press, to make the navigation easier. (will not implement if it not enough time.)
    - Random Enemy Spawn / Respawn [done]
        Random Respawn from left or right [done]
            IF random number = Odd, Re/Spawn on right. [done]
            ELSE Re/Spawn on left. [done]
        Enemy automatically walk from Right to Left. Then Left to Right.
    - Possible additional: Game difficulty, and multiple enemy before reaching the Boss Enemy.
    - Add Boss Enemy, Boss UI
    - Theory: Game mechanics, to be implemented, hopefully:
        - When the hero character get close to the enemy, and the character is in Attack mode, the enemy should deplete its life force or HP.
        - Enemy will die when being hit multiple times and no more life, same with the boss. (will check for gif file of some sort to show that enemy dies).
        - Hero will die too if he got multiple hits with an enemy or boss.
        - Hero will reduce/deplete its life force or HP if an enemy get close to him.
    - Movement mechanics:
        - for the hero [done] or enemy to go up decrease its top value.
        - increase top value to go down. [done]
        - decrease left value to go left. [done]
        - increase left value to go right. [done]
        - Since all div are in absolute, all divs will exceed the browser's width and height. So need to check it via If Else statement. [done]
            IF: the hero or enemy's top value near or is top=0
                Do not decrease top anymore, so it will not exceed the main-container's top value. [done]
            ELSE IF: bottom value is near or is = to the max height of the main-container.
                Do not increase top anymore, so it will not exceed the main-container's max height value. [done]
            ELSE IF: left value near or is left=0
                Do not decrease left anymore, so it will not exceed the main-container's left value. [done]
            ELSE IF: right value near or is = to the main-container's max width.
                Do not increase left anymore, so it will not exceed the main-container's max width value. [done]
    - Hero Movement can be via buttons [done] and keypressed (Have added a function and listener to check for keypressed). [done]
    - Enemy movement [done]
        Enemy moves facing to its direction, Forward, Up-Forward, Down-Forward. [done]
    - Boss Movement
    - Collision: [done]
        If Enemy's left or right near Hero's Left or Right [done]
        And if Hero is not it AttackMode status Hero will reduce Life and will bump backwards from where the collision happens.
    - Enemy and Boss movement will be triggered by a loop of function.
    - Theory: Will try to figure out a way for some enemy to target or get close to the hero character, like chasing it or attacking it. (will not implement if it not enough time.)
    - Add Game Status, this will tell if which part of the game is the user in:
        - Initial // the press any key menu. [done]
        - Menu // the part that will display, Start Game, Controls, Credits menus. [done]
        - Controls // not yet implemented. will show game mechanics, buttons, and instruction. 
            - Mouse:
                - Click Attack button for the Hero character to attack.
                - Click Up, Down, Left or Right buttons to move the Hero.
            - Keyboard:
                - Press Spacebar or Enter Key for the Hero character to attack.
                - Press Up, Down, Left or Right Arror Key to move the Hero.
            - Game Mechanics:
                - This is a fighting game, where the Hero "This is you" is caught up and being ambush by a group of swarming enemy.
                - Help the Hero survive the enemy's attack.
                - You can navigate the Hero Character using Mouse or Keyboard.
                - You gain Points by defeating the enemy.
                - Your Hero will lose a Life when an enemy get near or attack the Hero.
                - Your Hero will die when Hero's Life decreases to 0%.
        - Credits // not yet implemented. will show attributes where images and other assets are taken from.
